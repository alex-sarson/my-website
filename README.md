**TODO:**

- Bio Page
  - Structure out the article on the single page and use the same structure for the resume page as well
- Resume Page (CV)
- Projects
- Footer
  - Acknowledge material ui 3 in the footer
  - Social links are there in the socials component, have them in the footer
- Images for the tiles on the homepage
  - Figure out how to get different images in the array objects and still have them come through the tile component as a prop
